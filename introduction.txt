why data strutures ?
data structures is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively 
fast and powerful algorithm 
help to manage and organize data

abstract data type can have different type of implementation ds

big o talks about what heppens when n becomes big

static and dynamic arrays 

array - fixed leangth container containing n elements indexable from the range [0,n-1](indexable meaning each slot can be referenced with a number)
indexing starts at 0 and ends at n-1

where these are used
-sorting and accesing sequential data
-temporaray storage
-arrays and buffers( to read small chunks)
-lookup tables due to indexing 

static array (fixed size container )
(o(1),
no change in size 

dynamic array ( can acess , search ,insertion ,appending  and deletion )
can grow in size and even shrink 
how it is done ?
every time you add a new element more than the actual created size 
move the elements to static array
double the size
then add new element
